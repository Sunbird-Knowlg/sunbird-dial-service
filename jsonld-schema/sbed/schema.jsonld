Furthermore, attention is drawn to the possibility that an implementation of one or more features of this vocabulary may be the subject of a patent or other intellectual property     right that does not involve a Necessary Claim. Any such patent or other intellectual property right is not subject to the licencing obligations of GS1. Moreover, the agreement to grant licences provided under the GS1 IP Policy does not include IP rights and any claims of third parties who were not participants in the Work Groups. Accordingly, GS1 recommends that any organisation developing an implementation designed to be in conformance with this vocabulary should determine whether there are any     patents that may encompass a specific implementation that the organisation is developing in compliance with the vocabulary and whether a licence under a patent or other intellectual property right is needed. Such a determination of a need for licencing should be made in view of the details of the specific system designed by the organisation in consultation with their own patent counsel.
